# Semantic_Search
This project demonstrates how to use large language models and vector embeddings to build a semantic search system in Python. The project shows how to develop a personalized vector storage system using Python to efficiently store vector embeddings, how to implement cosine similarity function using numpy dot product to retrieve semantic search
